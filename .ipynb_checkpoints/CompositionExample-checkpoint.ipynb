Then, according to IVT, if we've chosen the second distribution, we want $v_i = x_i^{4}$, which means our sample $x_i$ from the distribution of interest will be $x_i = v_i^{1/4}$. Similarly, if we had chosen the first distribution (the 'else' in the algorithm), then we would have $v_i = x_i^{2}$, so according to IVT the sample we would want would be $x_i = v_i^{1/2}$.\n",
