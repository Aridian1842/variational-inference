      "#Introduction to Autoencoders#\n",
      "\n",
      "Autoencoders are a class of feedforward neural networks that learns to model the input X with as little distortion as possible (Baldi, 2012). A traditional autoencoder consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer, with directed connnections from input to hidden and from hidden to output (Figure 1, Baldi 2012). While this sounds a lot like a multilayer perceptron (MLP), an autoencoder has the same number of output units as input units, whereas an MLP has fewer output units. The point of an autoencoder is to reconstruct the input as faithfully as possible, whereas a multilayer perceptron is used, for example, for classification (so the output layer would have k nodes, where k is the number of classes). \n",

      "The transformation from input to hidden units is denoted B, and the transformation from hidden to output is A. The transformation B is a weight matrix that takes the input layer and multiplies each input node by a constant.\n",
      "\n",
      "So an autoencoder consists of an encoder, taking the data and learning a more compact (or more sparse, depending on the structure) representation of the input, and a decoder, which goes from the representation back to the input. \n",
      "Another important aspect to autoencoders is that their learning paradigm is entirely unsupervised: that is, there is no target (per se)."
