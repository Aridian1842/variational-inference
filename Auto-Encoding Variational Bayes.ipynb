      "Extending the classical variational inference framework to the stochastic (online and minibatch) version was completed by Hoffman et al (2013). In this work, Kingma and Welling make a further extension to non-factorable variational distributions. Their method has fewer assumptions than those of standard stochastic variational inference. In particular, their method, Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes, has no need for tractable expectations with respect to the marginal or conditional distributions at play.\n",
